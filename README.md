# Rose-plant-Disease-Detection

We used the Rose plants in our college to train our model. We used `EfficientNet` model to predict the rose plant diseases.

Here we didn't train the entire model but trained the last fc layers for finer predictions. Since the convolution parameters of pretrained model are well trained.
